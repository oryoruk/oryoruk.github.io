### Notes
#### Considerations on Design
- Eventually a modern HTML5 website, that
 - Works well across devices, browsers
 - Allows customization
 - Highlights code syntax
 - Displays media: plots, pictures elegantly
 - Has an RSS feed
 - Has a humorous 404 Page :) like this: http://rosalind.info/users/morukonur/

#### Plan
1. Initially:
  1. Start posting on Blogger
  2. Have a static page for now with content listed above and a link to the dynamic page: the blog
  3. Match the color scheme of the static page template with the Blogger template 
2. Later:
  4. Survey options for having a single dynamic page for all content
    - Jeykll on GitHub 
    - WordPress on private hosting (how will I maintain it through the dashbord, is it possible through GitHub?)
  5. Migrate entire blogger blog content and static page into the new dynamic one
